What?
=====

This is support library FortressCraft: Evolved mod development. It helps you deal with boring generic stuff.

Why?
====

- Minimal amount of code needed to register your blocks. Remember to inherit from Mod.
- Want to use machine from the game and replace it's behaviour? Inherit from OverloadedMachine<Original>. Write only code for your behaviour, generic stuff is handled for you.
- Multiblock machines where never so easy! Inherit IControl<YourMachine>.
- Neat structs and operations for block coordinates and orientations.
